  <h2>How to Register</h2>
  <p>To register for the GitHub contest, all you have to do is put your code
  and result file into a GitHub repository and then add this site as a post-receive
  hook.</p>
  
  <p>The first time you push to it, we will register your project and look
  for a <code>results.txt</code> file to grade.  After that, everytime you
  push to it we will just grade the results file.  Your highest score will
  be kept on <a href="/leaderboard">the leaderboard</a>.</p>

  <h2>How to Create a GitHub Account</h2>

    If you don't have a GitHub account, you can create one for free 
    at <a href="http://github.com/signup/free">http://github.com/signup/free</a>.

  <h2>How to Add A Post-Receive Hook</h2>
